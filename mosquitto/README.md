[Mosquitto][1] is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements
the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1.

## server

Sample config file: [mosquitto.conf](https://github.com/vimagick/dockerfiles/blob/master/mosquitto/data/etc/mosquitto.conf)

- `pwfile` is managed by [mosquitto_passwd][3].
- Two methods to support TLS:
  - You can get free TLS certificates from letsencrypt, `capath` is needed.
  - Self-signed TLS keys can be generated by [openssl][2], `cafile` is needed.

> It is important to use different certificate subject parameters for your self-signed CA, server and clients.

```bash
$ mkdir -p data/{etc,var,log}
$ chmod -R 777 data
$ touch data/etc/mosquitto.conf data/etc/pwfile
$ vi data/etc/mosquitto.conf
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose exec mosquitto sh
>>> cd /etc/mosquitto
>>> mosquitto_passwd -b pwfile username password
>>> cat pwfile
username:$6$IuF7JUzS1k/QoF3y$YpiClom7/==
>>> exit
$ docker-compose restart
$ tails -f data/log/mosquitto.log
